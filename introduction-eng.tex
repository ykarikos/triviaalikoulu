\chapter*{Preface in English}

The four hand-copied music partbooks of Pori Trivial School are a rare surviving example of North European school music, a repertoire of late 16th and early 17th century vocal polyphony prominent well into 18th century in the Baltic Sea region. The 1725 partbooks of Pori contain a representative selection of church music in 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 parts, varying from simple rustic settings and chorale harmonisations to sumptuous double choir motets. Composer names are almost entirely absent, but many of the works can be found with composer attributions elsewhere, in the widespread 17th century Lutheran music publications. The texts are mostly in Latin, but some are in Swedish, German and Finnish.

The music is set for typical 16th century vocal scoring of (dis)cantus, altus, tenor and bassus, roughly corresponding modern mezzo-soprano (boy treble or countertenor), high tenor, baritone and bass. It should be noted, however, that instrumental doubling or takeover of the parts was a normal practice of the time. This kind of music was also performed fully instrumentally by Stadtpfeifern and other instrumental ensembles, and frequently intabulated for keyboard instruments and plucked strings. Thus, a rich variety of options is available for historically-informed performers. The music also suits well enough for modern mixed choirs, perhaps with a slight pitch adjustment.

The partbooks have until now been only available in their original format: separate manuscript parts inconvenient for modern performers. This volume is the first modern edition of Pori Trivial School music books. The transcriptions published here were originally prepared by Johannes Vesterinen for the use of the Imatra-based early music ensemble Sonus Borealis, which has performed this music since 2005, and also recorded a selection in 2008. Digital layout was done by Yrjö Kari-Koskinen, and the preface was added by Jaakko Saarinen, who also helped tracking down some of the composers. Thanks are due to late Dr. Gudrun Viergutz for sharing her scholarship, and the staff of Smålands Musicarchiv in deciphering some Swedish handwriting.

This is not a scholarly, critical edition, but rather prepared for practical use. The music has been transferred from part-book format into a full score. Old clefs have been replaced with modern standard mixed-choir clefs. Original written pitch has been retained, apart from pieces in high clefs (chiavi alti, chiavetti), which have been transposed down a fourth according to the standard 16th and 17th century convention. Obvious errors have been corrected. Original ortography of texts is retained, but an alternative, 17th century Finnish translation has been added when available from other sources.
